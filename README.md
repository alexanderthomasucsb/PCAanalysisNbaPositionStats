# Principal Component Analysis of Nba Positions Based on in Game Statistics
This is a project I did to apply the concept of principal component analysis to the NBA. This plots a graph showing groupings of nba positions based on PCA. Based on the groupings you can see how similiar the stats are for nba positions in 2016.

In the future I would like to update this project to include more stats and compare different time periods of the nba to see how differences in position in the nba have gotten less pronounced over time
